# tic-tac-toe
A simple realisation of tic-tac-toe using 2-d arrays.
A 3×3 field is represented as a two-dimensional array with the char element type. Two players participate, they take turns and put their symbol — X or O (letters of the Latin alphabet) in the coordinates specified by them in the standard input. 
As soon as one of the players has three crosses or three noughts in a row, he wins. If there are no free cells left, and three matching elements are not found, then a draw is declared.
